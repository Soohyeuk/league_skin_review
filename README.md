# Introduction
Welcome! This is my first complete full-stack web application, which uses Django and ReactJS (TS). It's a website where you can leave a review about in-game purchase products freely (i.e. skins, items, perhaps DLCs).

##  :beginner: About
  This is my first full-stack project, so there are some inconsistencies in code and inaccuracies, please feel free to let me know!
  
  ### Tech stack and other:
   - Backend: Django (Libraries: Django Rest Framework, simple-JWT)
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript, and vanilla CSS (Libraries: Recoil, jwtDecode)
   - Database: SQLite (plan to change to PostgreSQL when deploying)
  
  ###  How It Started: 
  As a normal STEM student, I was enjoying my free time playing video games. When you enter the video game world, you begin to realize that there are many attractive features of a game that must be bought to be used. This is what we call an in-game purchase.
  
  I always wanted to buy these products as they often enhance the experience of gaming, but I can't just try them out in some fitting room. I needed to purchase it first to see how I liked it, and if I happened to dislike it, it was a simple way of losing money. 
  
  I did not like the feeling that comes after irresponsible spending, so I decided to create a website where all the users of a game to freely leave a review. In hopes that no one else wastes their money on something they dislike, I created this project. You can access it at [to be added link]. 



##  :wrench: Development

  ### Future Plan:
  I plan on adding more features once the website is fully running.
   1. Machine Learning model for reporting reviews with profane words. (Plan on building it myself as a learning experience).
   2. Adding more games to the website, instead of League of Legends only.  
   3. Creating a mobile app version (possibly using ReactNative). 

  ### This section is dedicated to how the REST APIs are built, an ER Diagram, and other features of the website.
